### REVIEW QUESTIONS

## True/False

#  1. A Python string literal is always enclosed in double quotes. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p. 130 "In Chapter 2 you learned that a string literal is formed by enclosing some
#     characters in quotation marks. Python also allows strings to be delineated by single quotes
#     (apostrophes). There is no difference; just be sure to use a matching set."]

#  2. The last charcter of a string s is at position len(s) TRUE
#     [Explanation: p. 131 "Notice that in a string of n characters, the last character is at position
#     n -1, because the index starts at 0. "]

#  3. A string always contains a single line of text. FALSE
#     [Explanation: A string is a sequence of characters. This sequence can be of any length. In fact,
#     it is also possible to have an empty string, i.e. "".]

#  4. In Python, "4" + "5" is "45". TRUE
#     [Explanation: This is not a a case of using the addition operator on integers. Since the literals are
#     enclosed in double quotations, we know that we are dealing with values of the data type string. The
#     operator + thus indicates the string operation, concatenation.]

#  5. Python lists are mutable, but strings are not. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.138 "While strings and lists are both sequences, there is an important difference
#     between the two. Lists are mutable. That means that the value of an item in a list can be modified
#     with an assignment statement. Strings, on the other hand, cannot be changed 'in place.'"]

#  6. ASCII is a standard from representing characters using numeric codes. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.140 "To avoid this sort of problem, computer systems today use industry standard
#     encodings. One important standard is called ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).
#     ASCII uses the numbers 0 through 127 to represent characters typically found on an (American) computer
#     keyboard, as well as certain special values known as control codds that are used to coordinate the sending
#     and receiving of information.]

#  7. The split method breaks a string into a list of substrings, and join does the opposite. TRUE
#     [Explanation: p.144 "For our decoder, we will make use of the split method. This method splits a string into
#     a list of substrings. By default, it will split the string whever a space occurs. p. 148 see table.]

#  8. A substitution cipher is a good way to keep sensitive information secure. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.150 "Our simple encoding/decoding programs use a very weak form of encryption known as a
#     substituation cipher....Since each letter is always encoded by the same symbol, a codebreaker coud use
#     statistical inofrmation about the frequency of various letters and some simple trial and error testing to
#     discover the original message."]

#  9. The add method can be used to add an item to the end of a list. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.147 "The append method can be used to add an item at the end of a list. This is often used to
#     build a list an item at a time.]

# 10. The process of associating a file with an object in a program is called "reading" the file. FALSE
#     [Explanation: p.159 "We need some way to associate a file on disk with an object in a program. This process
#     is called opening a file. Once a file has been opened, its contents can be accessed through the associated
#     file object.]

## Multiple Choice

#  1. Accessing a single character out of a string is called: [D]
#     a) slicing     b) concatenation     c) assignment     d) indexing

#  2. Which of the following is the same as s[0:-1] [C]
#     a) s[-1]     b) s[:]     c) s[:len(s)-1]     d) s[0:1len(s)]

#  3. What function gives the Unicode value of a character? [A]
#     a) ord     b) ascii     c) chr     d) eval
#     [Explanation p.140 "Python provides a couple of built-in functions that allow us to switch back
#     and forth between characters and the numberic values used to represent them in strings. The ord
#     function returns the numeric ("ordinal") code of a single-character string, while chr goes the
#     other direction."]

#  4. Which of the following can not be used to convert a string of digits into a number? [D]
#     a) int     b) float     c) str     d) eval

#  5. A sucessor to ASCII that includes characters from (nearly) all written languages is [C]
#     a) TELLI     b) ASCII+ +     c) Unicode     d) ISO
#     [Explanation: p.140 "Most modern systems are moving to Unicode, a much larger standard that
#     aims to include the characters of nearly all written languages."]

#  6. Which string method converts all the characters of a string to upper case? [D]
#     a) capitalize     b) capwords     c) uppercase     d) upper
#     [Explanation: p.147 see example. p.148: see table.]

#  7. The string "slots that are filled in by the format method are marked by: [D]
#     a) %     b) $     c) []     d) {}
#     [Explanation: p.156 "Curly braces ({}) inside the template-string mark 'slots' into which the
#     provided values are inserted. The information inside the curly braces tells which value goes in
#     the slot and how the value should be formatted.]

#  8. Which of the following is not a file-reading method in Python? [C]
#     a) read     b) readline     c) readall     d) readlines
#     [Explanation: p.161 "Python provides three related operations for reading information from a
#     file [read, readline, readlines]."]

#  9. The term for a program that does its input and output with files is [C]
#     a) file-oriented     b) multi-line     c) batch     d) lame

# 10. Before reading or writing to a file, a file object must be created via
#     a) open     b) create     c) File     d) Folder


## Discussion

#  1. Given the initial statements:
#
#     s1 = "spam"
#     s2 = "ni!"
#
#     Show the result of evaluating each of the following string expressions.
#                                        Expected                   | Actual
#     a) "The Knights who say, " + s2    The Knights who say ni!    | 'The Knights who say ni!'
#     b) 3 * s1 + 2 * s2                 spamspamspamni!ni!         | 'spamspamspamni!ni!'
#     c) s1[1]                           pam                        | 'p'      [Careless mistake]
#     d) s1[1:3]                         pam                        | 'pa'     [Careless mistake]
#     e) s1[2] + s2[:2]                  aspa                       | 'ani'    [Careless mistake]
#     f) s1 + s2[-1]                     spam!                      | 'spam!'
#     g) s1.upper()                      SPAM                       | 'SPAM'
#     h) s2.upper().ljust(4) * 3         NI! NI! NI!                | 'NI! NI! NI! '
#
#     [Note on single quotes that Python returns when evaluating string expressions:
#     The difference between string object and the actual printed output is that the string object
#     is not enclosed in any quotations when it is printed. The Python shell shows the vlaue of strings
#     qua strings by enclosing them in single quotes. See p.131]

#  2. Given the same initial statements as in the previous problem, show a Python expression that
#     that could construct each of the following results by performing string operations on s1 and s2.

#     a) "NI"                            s2.upper()                               | s2[0:2].upper()      
#     b) "ni!spamni!"                    s2 + s1 + s2                             | same
#     c) "Spam Ni! Spam Ni! Spam Ni!"    ((" "join.([s1, s2] ) * 3).capitalize()  | ?
#     d) "spam"                          s1                                       |
#     e) ["sp","m"]                      s1.split("a")                            | same
#     f) "spm"                           s1[0:2] + s1[-1]                         | correct

#     [The code above yieldes the results in single quotes. How would I change the code to produce
#     double quotes as the results which have double quotes?]

#  3. Show the output that would be generated by each of the following program fragments.

#     a) for ch in "aardvark":
#            print(ch)
#        Output:
#        Expected                                 |  Actual
#        a
#        a
#        r
#        d
#        v
#        a
#        r
#        k


#     b) for w in "Now is the winter of our discontent...".split():
#            print(w)
#        Output:
#        Expected                                 |
#        Nowisthewinterofourdiscontent...

#     c) for w in "Mississippi".split("i"):
#            print(w, end=" ")
#        Output:
#        Expected:                                 |
#        for w in [M, ss,ss, pp]
#            print(M, end=" ")
#            M
#            print(ss, end=" ")
#            M ss
#            print(ss, end=" ")
#            M ss ss
#            print(pp, end=" ")
#            M ss ss pp
#
#        M ss ss p
#
#     d) msg = ""
#        for s in "secret".split("e"):
#            msg = msg + s
#        print(msg)
#
#        Output:
#        Expected:
#        msg = ""
#        for s in [s, cr, t]:
#                = "" + s
#            msg = s + cr
#            msg = scr + t
#            msg = scrt
#       print(msg)
#       print(scrt)
#
#       scrt
#   
#     e) msg = ""
#        for ch in "secret":
#        msg = msg + chr(ord(ch)+1)
#        print(msg)
#        [I will not do step-by-step evaluation here.
#        It's clear that the fragment prints a string
#        by taking the Unicode value of each letter,
#        adding 1 to it, and then evaluating the int
#        to return the corresponding Unicode character,
#        thus altering the unicode of each character in
#        "secret" by +1, cocatenating the result in msg
#        each time the loop iterates.]
#        s = 115 + 1 = 116 = t
#        e = 101 + 1 = 102 = f
#        c = 99 + 1 = 100 = d
#        r = 114 + 1 = 115 = s

#        tfdsfu

#  4. Show the string that would result from each of the following string formatting operations. If the
#     operation is not legal, explain why:

#     a) "Looks like (1) and (0) for breakfast".format("eggs", "spam")
#        The operation is not legal. Curly braces are required around 1 and 0.

#     b) "There is {0} {1} {2} {3}".format(1, "spam", 4 "you")
#         'There is 1 spam 4 you.'

#     c) "Hello {0}".format("Susan", "Computewell")
#        'Hello Susan'

#     d) "{0:0.2f} {0:0.2f}".format(2.3, 2.3468)
#        '2.30 2.30'

#     e) "{7.5f} {7.5f}".format(2.3, 2.3468)
#        The operation is not legal. There is no index followed by : supplied in each of the curly braces.

#     f) "Time left {0:02}:{1:05.2f}".format(1, 37.374)
#        'Time left 1:37.37'

#     g) "{1:3}".format("14")
#        '14'

#  5. Explain why public key encryption is more useful for securing commmunications on the Internet than
#     private (shared) key encryption.
#     Private keys use the same key to both encrypt and decrypt communications before sending and after receiving.
#     This increases the probability of malicious use.
#     Public keys entail a public key to encrypt communciations before sending. However, the communications can
#     only be decrypted with another key that is specific to the recipient.


### PROGRAMMING EXERCISES

#  1. The example code files for Chapter 5 include a date conversion program, dateconvert2.py. This program could be
#     simplified with string formatting. Modify the program to use the string format method for its output.
#
# dateconvert2.py
#     Converts day month and year numbers into two date formats

def main():
    # get the day month and year as numbers
    day = int(input("Enter the day number: "))
    month = int(input("Enter the month number: "))
    year = int(input("Enter the year: "))

    date1 = str(month)+"/"+str(day)+"/"+str(year)

    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", 
              "May", "June", "July", "August", 
              "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    monthStr = months[month-1]
    date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ", " + str(year)

    print("The date is {0} or {1}.".format(date1, date2))

#  2. A certain CS professor gives 5-point quizzes that are graded on the scale 5-A, 4-B, 3-C, 2-D, 1-F, 0-F. Write a
#     program that accepts a quiz score as an input and prints out the corresponding grade.
#
#     Input: quiz score defined as a a number from 1 to 5
#     Output: a letter grade defined as a string: A, B, C, D, F
#
#     Create a squence of grades as a string, where index/position corresponds to letter grade 
#     For a number supplied by user, convert to int and get the index, print the appropriate grade
#
# gradeconverter.py
#     Converts a quizscore from 1-5 to the corresponding grade

def main():
    # Create list of possible letter grades
    lettergradescale = "FFDCBA"
    # Prompt user for quiz grade
    quizgrade = int(input("Please enter the quiz grade on a scale from 0 to 5: "))
    lettergrade = lettergradescale[quizgrade]
    print("Your quiz grade of {0} corrsesponds to the letter grade of {1}.".format(quizgrade, lettergrade))

#  3. A certain CS professor gives 100-point exams that are graded on the scale 90-100:A, 80-89:B, 70-79:C, 60-69:D, <60:F.
#     Write a program that accepts an exam score as input and prints out the corresponding grade.
#
#     Input: an exam score defined as an int from 0 t0 100
#     Output: a letter grade defined as one of 5 possible strings: A, B, C, D, F where 90-100:A, 80-89:B, 70-79:C, 60-69:D, <60:F
#
#     Define int ranges for each letter grade
#     For a number  grade entered by user, use if elif statements to determine letter grade
#
#     Note: Another possible solution, but much less efficient, would be to create a sequence as a string or list where each
#     list grade would be a list item indexed at its coresponding value, so in the indeces from 90 to 100, there would be an "A"
#
#     Since I don't feel like typing a lot, I will use the more efficient solution even if decision structures have not been
#     covered yet.
#
#     Then again, I will stick with the book's plan and write up the less efficient version.
#
# examgrade.py
#     Converts an exam grade to a letter grade

def main():
    lettergradescale = "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDDCCCCCCCCCCBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAA"
    examgrade = int(input("Please enter the quiz grade on a scale from 0 to 100: "))
    lettergrade = lettergradescale[examgrade]
    print("Your grade of {0} corresponds to the letter grade of {1}.".format(examgrade, lettergrade))

#  4. An acronym is a word formed by taking the first letters of the words in a phrase and making a word from them. For
#     example, RAM is an acronym for "random access memory." Write a program that allows the user to type in a phrase and
#     then outputs the acronym for that phrase. Note: The acronym should be all uppercase, even if the words in the phrase
#     are not capitalized.
#
#     Input: A string of words demarcated by spaces
#     Output: A string that is an acronym of the first letter of each word in the string
#
#     Get input from user as a string
#     Use split method to split string into its component words as demarcated by a space (" ")
#     Get first letter of each word using loop accumulator
#     Join first letter of each word into a new string
#     Capitalize new string
#     Print string for user

#  5. Numerologists claim to be able to determine a person's character traits based on the "numeric value" of a name. The value
#     of a name is determined by summing up the values of the letters of the name where "a" is 1, "b" is 2, "c" is 3, up to "z"
#     being 26. For example, the name "Zelle" would have the value 26 + 5 + 12 + 12 + 5 = 60 (which happens to be a very
#     auspicious number, by the way). Write a program that calculates the numeric value of a single name provided as input.
#
#  input: a last name defined as a string supplied by the suer
#  output: a numeric value defined as an int that is the sum of values assigned to the individual strings
#  User inputs a string, and the program outputs the sum of the values of the invidual strings where the values are
#  determined as follows, a = 1, b = 2, etc.

#  Create a sequence of characters as lookup table starting with an empty space at index 0 to align index with value of each letter
#  User supplies string as input
#  For each character in the input string, return where it occurs in the string, and add its index value to an accumulating sum
#  Print sum
#
# numerology.py
# A program that determines the numeric value of a name where a = 1, b = 2, etc.

def main():
    lookup = "0abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    inputname = str(input("Please use letters only to enter your name."))
    formatinputname = inputname.lower()

#  6. Expand your soluation to the previous problem to allow the calcualtion of a complete name such as "John Marvin Zelle" or
#     "John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith." The total value is just the sum of the numberic values of all the names.
#
#  Algorithm same as above, but need to use split method to make a list, then loop through each list element with above
#  process for determining numeric value

# numerology.py
# A program that determines the numeric value of a name where a = 1, b = 2, etc.

#  7. A Caesar cipher is a simple substitution sipher based on the diea of shifting each letter of the plaintext message a fixed
#     number (called the key) of positions in the alphabet. For example, if the key is 2, the word "Sourpuss" would be encoded as
#     "Uqwtrwuu." The original message can be recovered by "reencoding" it using the negative of the key.
#
#     Write a program that can enconde and decode Caesar ciphers. The input to the progrma will be a string of plaintext and the
#     value of the key. The output will be an encoded message where each character in the original message is replaced by shifting
#     it key characters in the Unicode character set. For exmaple, if ch is a character in the string and key is the amount to shift,
#     then the character that replaces ch can be calculated as: chr(ord(ch) + key).

#  8. One problem with the previous exercise is that it does not deal with the case when we "drop off the end" of the alphabet. A
#     true Caesar cipher does the shifting in a circular fashion where the next character after "z" is "a." Modify your solution
#     to the previous problem to make it circular. You may assume that the input consists only of letters and paces.
#     Hint: Make a string containing all the cahracters of your alphabet and use positions in this string as your code. You do not
#     have to shift "z" int "a"; jsut make sure that you use a circular shift over the entire sequence of characters in your alphabet
#     string.

#     Note to self: modular.

#  9. Write a program that counts the number of words in a sentence entered by the user.
#
#  Given a sentence, the program will count the number of words.
#  input = a sentence defined as a string
#  output = the number of words defined as an int
#
#  Prompt user for input.
#  Use split method to split string into list of words.
#  Print length of list.

def main():
    sentence = str(input("Please enter your sentence here: "))
    sentenceintowords = sentence.split()
    numberofwords = len(sentenceintowords)
    
    print("The number of words in", end = "/n")
    print(sentence, end = "/n")
    print("is", end = "/n")
    print(numberofwords, ".")

#need to test
                
# 10. Write a program that calculates the average word length in a sentence entered by the user.

# 11. Write an improved version of the chaos.py program from Chapter 1 that allows a user to input two initial values and the number of
#     of iterations, and then prints a nicely formatted table showing how the values change over time. For example, if the starting
#     values were .25 and .26 with 10 iterations, the table might look like this:

#     index    0.25         0.26

# 12. Write an improved version of the futval.py program from Chapter 2.
#     Your program will prompt the user for the amoutn of the investment, the annualized interest rate, and the number of years of the
#     investment. The program will then output a nicely formatted table that tracks the value of the investment year by year. Your
#     output might look something like this:
#
#     Year     Value
#     ----------------
#       0     $2000.00
#       1     $2200.00

# 13. Redo any of the previous programming exercises to make them batch-oriented (using text files for input and output).

# 14. Word Count. A common utility on Unix/Linux systems is a small program called "wc." This program analyzes a file to determine the
#     number of lines, words and characters contained therein. Write your own verison of wc. The program should accept a file name as
#     input and then print three numbers showing the count of lines, words, and characters in the file.

# 15. Write a program to plot a horizontal bar chart of student exam scores. Your program should get input from a file. The first line
#     of the file contains the count of the number of students in the file, and each subsequent line contains a student's last name
#     followed by a score in the range 0-100. Your program should draw a horizontal rectangle for each student where the length of the
#     bar represents the student's score. The bars should all line up on their left-hand edges.
#
#     Hint: Use the number of students to determine the size of the window and its coordinates. [Note to self: point of control.]
#     Bonus: label the bars at the left with the students' names.

# 16. Write a program to draw a quiz score histogram. Your program should read data from a file. Each line of the file contains a number
#     in the range 0-10. Your program must count the number of occurences of each score and then draw a vertical bar chart with a bar for
#     each possible score (0-10) with height corresponding to the count of that score. For example, if 15 students got an 8, then the
#     the height of the bar for 8 should be 15.
#     Hint: Use a list that stores the count for each possible score.

#     1. Problem analysis:
#        How to count number of occurences of possible test scores and represent the count on a vertical chart.
#
#     2. Specification:
#        Inputs: file with test scores
#        Output: histogram representing occurences of each score
#
#     3. Design (algorithm)
#        import graphics library
#        import dialog box for opening file
#        get the file name
#        open the file
#        read file
#        create empty list for scores
#        process each line of the input file
#        get each score
#        append each score to empty list in output file
#        count the number of occurences of each score
#        store each count in a new list
#        create graphical template for histogram using a loop
#        define one rectangle (bar) and use variable for height
#        define space between bars as equal to width of one bar
#        label each bar from 0 to 10 using loop count
#        use
#
